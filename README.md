## Welcome Message:
<b>
<P>Welcome ðŸ‘‹ gues to our testing course GitHub repository! We're excited to share our knowledge and experience with you. In this repo, you'll find a collection of resources, including code examples, tutorials, and quizzes to help you learn testing concepts. Dive in, learn, and have fun!</P>
</b>

## Objective:
<b>
<P>he objective of this course is to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of software testing principles, methodologies, and techniques. By the end of this course, We will be able to design, develop, and execute effective tests to ensure the quality and reliability of software applications.</P></b>

## Introduction:
<b><p>Software testing is a critical component of the software development lifecycle. It ensures that software applications meet the required standards of quality, reliability, and performance. Effective testing helps to identify and fix defects early in the development process, reducing the overall cost and time to market. In this course, we will cover the fundamental concepts, principles, and techniques of software testing, including black box and white box testing, test design.</p></b>
